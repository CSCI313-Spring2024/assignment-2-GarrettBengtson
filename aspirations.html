      <p id="bioPara">
        I am 21 years old. My birthday is on July 12th. I went to Rush City High
        School for all of my primary school days, and I met a lot of friends
        there. Upon graduation, I was the salutatorian of my class; and I gave a
        speech on our graduation day. I first came to NDSU as a mathematics
        major, but after a year I was not enjoying that path. That is when I
        decided to switch to Computer Science for my major. I had taken a few
        coding classes as electives before, and I really liked them.

        My ideal career would be working with databases or frontend development.
        I have plenty of experience with databases and SQL, and I enjoy working
        with data a lot. I am not as experienced in frontend development, but I
        also enjoy it. I don't really mind where I live, so I would take most
        job opportunities if I think they are good for me.
